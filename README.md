# holmscan

A simple Python command line tool to interact with [Holm Security VMP](https://www.holmsecurity.com/vulnerability-assessment).

## History

The motivation to start this tool is our drive to automate all the things. So naturally we wanted to integrate vulnerability scanning as part of our CI/CD pipeline.

We organized a hackathon at our offices and especially made it our goal to contribute to the annual [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). This is one of the open source tools we worked on October 23:rd 2018.

## Scope

We intend to implement functionality for this tool to be able to kick off scans in an automated way. The scope is therefore limited but we may expand the scope in the future. Contributions are welcome.
